# THIS IS ONLY A PRACTICE REPOSITORY, THIS IS NOT A PROJECT INTENDED FOR DEPLOYMENT

This is a repository backup for RMHolsen to practice the skills learned in code bootcamp, and to fuss around with different things. It is basically a play-space and not intended for eventual deployment. If you want to see the specific notes of what is being worked on within this repository feel free to read the practice notes, which go into some detail about what each model is and what skills are being practiced within. 

This repository was copied off of a Flatiron Lab, so there may be some artifact files; where I have noticed or remembered to do so I have deleted and replaced the text with my own but leaning on the Flatiorn lab seemed the best way to get this up and running at the time.
