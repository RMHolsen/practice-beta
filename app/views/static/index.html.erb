<p>This is an index for all the crap I've been coding while I've been practicing Rails, learning Rails and Javascript undoubtedly will go in here somewhere too. Because the objects and pages I've been building are also useful for the practice of writing novels, I'm putting up some very simple styling to keep track of it all. I've sorted everything into three categories: Background, for various indices of objects and organizations, things that I may want to put in books at some point; Projects, roughly based on my Sinatra project and to keep all my various projects in check; and Research, to list websites and books that I want to remember, keep track of, visit again, purchase eventually, what have you.</p>
