<p>To be honest, by the time anyone reads this there may be three people who remember what the Workshop was.</p>
<p>This is an index in two ways. It is an index and a means of display for all the skills I've been learning at the Flatiron Software Boot Camp, Rails and eventually JavaScript and everything else. And because these skills are most useful when paired with chunks of information for sample text and objects, this is an index of creative projects I've been working on, research books I want to collect, etc. </p>
<p>Most of the information in the Background section will be for general use. Most of the information in the Projects section will be projects I'm working on, but the information that is public knowledge because I yak about it incessantly on Twitter. At some point if this goes live I will get a Creative Commons license up here and redo this text so I don't suppose anyone but maybe potential employers will see it anyway until that happens, but here is some text explaining myself in case it does go live for whatever odd reason. It's 2021, life is already just so weird.</p>
