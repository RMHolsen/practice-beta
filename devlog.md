Okay, finally making a log here.
Practiced drop down menu and autocomplete menu once each, both seem to have to be made from an object
BUT, crucially, they can also just pass in a string from the object rather than the object itself.
(Maybe practice them passing an object association too: forms_and_basic_associations lab)
Tidied up the views some, created a background documents tracker which might be the most useful thing ever.
BUG NOTE: What the fuck is going on with the artifact routes. That's a few sections later, I guess.
